# ZSH has a quirk where `preexec` is only run if a command is actually run (i.e
# pressing ENTER at an empty command line will not cause preexec to fire). This
# can cause timing issues, as a user who presses "ENTER" without running a command
# will see the time to the start of the last command, which may be very large.

# To fix this, we create STARSHIP_START_TIME upon preexec() firing, and destroy it
# after drawing the prompt. This ensures that the timing for one command is only
# ever drawn once (for the prompt immediately after it is run).
